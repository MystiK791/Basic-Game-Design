# Basic Game Design
A PyGame tutorial that I spent a gross total of 2-and-a-half hours building and then customizing

## How to use
1. Get python from python.org
2. The program will install Pygame automatically if it doesn't detect it on your machine (credit to GD Colon for this code snippet)
3. Enjoy this (admittedly terrible) game!
